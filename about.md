Introvert in real life. Extrovert on the internet

### All You Need to Know
I don't partake in the DC V Marvel debate. My favorite superhero is Batman but my favorite superhero's alter ego is Peter Parker. Though I do love Deadpool and his nonsensical ways. Speaking of, I do relate with Shazam and his whole "boy stuck in an adult's body" thing, but on the other hand Black Panther is undoubtedly(debatedly?) Kenyan so...
Also, I love the books from Rick Riordan(Percy Jackson series) and J.K. Rowling (Harry Potter) cos my taste is, and has always been (always be?) juvenile.

I'm a Virgo so I guess I'm a perfectionist? With an eye for detail? Though this doesn't seem to carry over to orderliness for my room is always a mess.

I am Me.

And I'd like to know who you are, so
