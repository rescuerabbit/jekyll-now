They say that when you die, your life flashes before your eyes... Jacob found this to be a cruel cruel lie. He had been hoping to see her face albeit one last time, to see that lopsided smile, to see those crinkles and laughlines that framed that sensual mouth. He had been hoping for that last reprieve, but alas, all he felt was cold, a silent nothingness as his soul expired and his eyes stared, unseeing, at that peeling, beige-painted ceiling.

His assailant still stood there, a silhouette in the struggling morning light, framed by the door. His fedora pulled low over his face and his trenchcoat collar turned up against the biting morning chill. He stared, unmoving at his once-friend (or as close to 'friend' that one could get in this line of business). "Sorry old chap." he said under his breath, as he stepped over the now lifeless form of Jacob and the growing puddle of blood into the desolate single room. He walked over to the bedside table and opened a drawer, quickly rummaging through the contents. He gave an unsatisfied grunt and moved over to the narrow cot, pulling a penknife from his coat pocket, flipping it open and driving it into the mattress. He dove his hand in the rip he just made and growled in frustration. "Where is it, you wily old fox?" He rhetorically asks an unanswering Jacob. He pulled out and old-fashioned flip-phone from his pocket, pressed one number and brought it up to his ear. It was answered on the first ring. "It's not here sir." He said then paused, "I understand." He answered and hung up. Walking over to Jacob, he pauses for a moment, absently looking at the knife embedded in his chest, then he carefully stepped over him and the still growing puddle into the morning gloom. "Such a shame," he says to himself, "that was my favorite knife."

"This wasn't meant to happen." Said one voice. "What do you mean?" replied another, "We knew the risks, they are fragile life-forms." he continued. "Yes but..." the first voice trails off. "He was just different. He was supposed to complete what we needed." "Yeah, so you say." replied the second. "Just send him to recycling like the rest." "No." enters a third voice in a more commanding tone, obviously an authority figure. "He goes back." "What!!" exclaims the second "But that has never-" "Send him back." interrupts the third voice. It is clear from his tone that he the conversation is over.

Jacob wakes with a jolt, a sharp pain flares across his chest lighting up every single nerve ending and bringing dancing stars to his eyes. Two gentle but firm hands grab hold of his shoulders and pin him back unto the pillow. "Just relax sir or you'll tear your stitches." The room smells strongly of antiseptic. He feels numb and groggy and with great effort turns his head just enough to see the source of the voice. It's a plump, middle aged woman with kindly eyes and a crisp white and blue nurse's uniform. "Where..." he starts, the very effort of talking sending flaring sharp pain up his chest. "Sir, you're at the St. Raphael's Hospital sir." she says, "And you're extremely lucky sir, the paramedics who found you say you had no pulse. They put you in the ambulance and were to bring you straight to the morgue, then on the way here your wound there starts bleeding again and you got a pulse. Nobody here can explain it. You must have an angel looking out for you sir." She continues, smiling kindly and fluffing his pillows.

"Yes, I must have..." Jacob thinks. But something gnaws at the back of his mind... a conversation he heard, an impossible conversation that he couldn't have possibly been hearing, and three words, three distinct words spoken in an authoritative voice that he can't forget, "Send him back."...
