DISCLAIMER: The author does realise, and wishes to disclose, that he has as much “game” as a myopic pre-teen with buck-teeth and bug-eye glasses being given a wedgie while holding up a sign that says “Will you go to prom with me.” Directed to the head of the cheerleading squad.
He also wishes to disclose that he watches a LOT of movies…and romcoms. He says “sue me” and shrugs. He also says please lift with your legs, not with your back. Safety first afterall. (Get it?? Because you’re PICKING UP girls- I don’t know why I bother sometimes)

Tip #1 : Leave the ‘eyes' at home
This more so applies to those sons of Adam out there with clinically diagnosed myopia i.e short-sight. Yes you handsome devils you. You who actually do pay to see life in HD you. Do go ahead and leave those glasses at home because your girl-friend (note the hyphen) told you, and I quote: “But you look sexier without them!!” Yes. So do go ahead and leave them. I assure you that all night, that lass by the bar will be making googly eyes at you, sending you signs in all sign languages under heaven and all the while you’ll be sitted there, squinting into the near distance thinking “I wonder what that pink fuzzy blob in the sexy little fuzzy blob by the bar looks like.” Oh and did I mention that squinting is instant bonus points? Why do you think all the fairer-skinned populace be squinting in selfies?
Tip #2: Take the term 'Bros night out’ literally.
Ah there’s nothing worse than having your band of merrymen, your brotherhood of knights, your band of thieves (what?) get broken up by an interruptive lass am I right? Yes, the cod dictates that “if ye came into the establishment together, then ye must leave together!” Follow the code religiously lads. Afterall, it’s what seperates us from the animals.
Another acceptable and equally upstanding code is “Homies over Hoes” not that I understand what farming appliances have to do with it but hey, we don’t write the code, we just follow it.
Tip #3: When invited out for drinks. Get absolutely hammered.
Treat every invitation to drinks as an open bar session and get absolutely knackered. After all, as the age-old adage goes; “Pacing yourself is for suckas” and you, my enlightened fellow son of Adam are definitely NOT a “sucka”. So do try to outdrink the legendary Thor. Raise a glass of mead to every member in your clan, to every hair on your head, to every star in the sky. Also, bonus points get too drunk, sleepy or too busy dancing to settle the bill. They’ll definitely invite you out more often for your charming personality and quick wit.
Tip#4: Butt in.
The author notes that this tip has on several rare occassions, been known to fail and the poor lad in question has actually picked up a lass. However he suggests that prior to putting this tip into action that you follow the previous one to a tee, then for bonus points, choose to go dancing.
Once you have set on this course of action, identify your lass on the dancefloor…that lass who’s out there gyrating and moving like there isn’t a care in the world. Bonus points awarded if she’s fairly sober/ barely tipsy AND accompanied by a son of Adam.
However as a disclaimer; the author shall not he held liable for any griveous bodily harm sustained in the pursuit of this course of action.
Tip #5: Do absolutely nothing.
That’s right lads, just be your lazy, disinterested self. Bonus points awarded for droopy eyes, no smiles or eye contact.
Now the power is in your hands young grasshoppers. Go forth, and NOT pick up girls at clubs. You’re welcome.
